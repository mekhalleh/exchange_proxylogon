## Introduction

  An issue was discovered in Microsoft Exchange Server that allows an attacker bypassing the authentication and impersonating as the admin (CVE-2021-26855). By chaining this bug with another
  post-auth arbitrary-file-write vulnerability to get code execution (CVE-2021-27065).

  As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on Microsoft Exchange Server.

  This vulnerability affects (Exchange 2013 Versions < 15.00.1497.012, Exchange 2016 CU18 < 15.01.2106.013, Exchange 2016 CU19 < 15.01.2176.009, Exchange 2019 CU7 < 15.02.0721.013,
  Exchange 2019 CU8 < 15.02.0792.010).

  All components are vulnerable by default.

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
2. Do: `use auxiliary/scanner/http/exchange_proxylogon`
3. Do: `set RHOSTS [IP]`
4. Do: `run`

## Options

1. `Proxies`. This option is not set by default.
2. `RPORT`. The default setting is `443`. To use: `set RPORT [PORT]`
3. `SSL`. The default setting is `true`.
4. `THREADS`. The default setting is `1`.
5. `VHOST`. This option is not set by default.
